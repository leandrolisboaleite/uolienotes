# User mode & Kernel Mode

A processor in a computer running Windows has two different modes: _user mode_ and _kernel mode_.

The processor switches between the two modes depending on what type of code is running on the processor. Applications run in user mode, and core operating system components run in kernel mode. While many drivers run in kernel mode, some drivers may run in user mode.
